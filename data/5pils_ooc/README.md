# 5Pils-OOC 

5Pils-OOC is an extension of the [5Pils](https://github.com/UKPLab/5pils) dataset, published at EMNLP 2024.

It is a test set for two multimodal fact-checking tasks:
    üïµÔ∏è Context prediction (Image contextualization): predicting the true context of an image published on the web
    üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Veracity prediction: predicting whether a caption is accurate or out-of-context for an image


5Pils-OOC contains 624 images, each paired with an accurate caption and an out-of-context caption. All annotations have been extracted from articles written by fact-checking experts. 
The dataset is released under a **CC-BY-SA 4.0** license.
To download the images, please refer to the instructions of [5Pils](https://github.com/UKPLab/5pils).
